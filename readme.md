Ditch Handwritten Essays.
EssaySafe allows you to take exams in the cloud.
In class. Without switching windows.
We disable Alt-Tab and any other method of switching out of the exam with a chrome extension and a desktop app.

Our main application is built in Django running on Google App Engine

We use the Google Docs API to let students and professors edit and track documents

The Box API is used as well to allow download of .doc versions. Professors can track their classes in Google Docs and/or Box.

The Bing Maps API allows professors to track where their students are during the exam and ensure everybody is in the room during the test.
